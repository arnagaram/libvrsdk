# libvrsdk

Go SDK for programming the Nuage VRS (Virtual Routing Switching) platform. Documentation for the SDK can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nuagenetworks/libvrsdk?tab=doc). In addition, there are plenty of examples in the unit test files (api/NuageAPI_test.go) on how to use the SDK.
